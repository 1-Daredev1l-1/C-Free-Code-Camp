Compilation: 

        . PROBLEM: 
            . Importing header units didn't work with clang for me, if I try to import both iostream and 
                string like we did for this example with other compilers. The issue seems documented 
                here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/58540
            . Reverting to good old includes in the global module for this example with clang.
        . Commands: 

            . clang++ -std=c++20 -stdlib=libc++ -x c++-module math.ixx --precompile -o math_stuff.pcm
            . clang++ -std=c++20 -stdlib=libc++ main.cpp -fprebuilt-module-path=. math_stuff.pcm -o rooster
